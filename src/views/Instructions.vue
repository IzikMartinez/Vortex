      >Step 1: Your fountain should come pre-assembled with minor assembly
      required. <br /><br />
      Step 2: Inside the base of your fountain you should find two pumps, hoses,
      and clamps. The only tool you will need for assembly is a flat head
      screwdriver
      <br /><br />
      Step 3: Take the vessel that was inside the basin and flip it right side
      up. Ensure, that the wiring for your lighting and pumps goes into the cut
      out rim along the basin.
      <br /><br />
      Step 4: Take one of the hoses and feed it through one of the holes closest
      to the inlet valve.
      <br /><br />
      Step 5: Next, take one of your clamps and attach it to the hook therefore
      securing it to the pump with your screwdriver
      <br /><br />
      Step 6: Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the other pump
      <br /><br />
      Step 7: Connect the pvc fittings and ensure a snug fit
      <br /><br />
      Step 8: Ensure that the pumps are sitting upright and basin is level
      <br /><br />
      Step 9: Add water and ensure that the basin is full before plugging in the
      pumps
      <br /><br />
      Step 10: Plug it in and enjoy your Vortex Meditation Fountain
      <br /><br />
